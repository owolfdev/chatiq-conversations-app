# Response Builder

This should be a **setup-time AI assist**, not a core capability — and it should be framed differently per plan.

---

## How it should work by plan

### **Free**

- ❌ Not included by default
- ✅ Shown as an **upsell**

  - “Generate pre-configured responses with AI (trial / upgrade)”

- During the 30-day trial:

  - Allow limited use (e.g. 5–10 generations)

- After trial:

  - Disabled unless they upgrade

This creates a _very natural_ upgrade nudge:

> “This would be fast with AI → upgrade to Green/Pro.”

---

### **Green**

- ✅ Available
- ⚠️ With **explicit warning**:

  - “Uses AI to generate setup content. Your bot replies remain non-AI.”

- Cap usage (e.g. 20–50 generations / month)

This preserves Green’s promise:

- **No AI at runtime**
- AI only as a _configuration helper_

That distinction is defensible and understandable.

---

### **Pro / Team**

- ✅ Fully available
- Higher or no practical cap
- Framed as a productivity feature, not an AI caveat

---

## Why this works well

1. **Solves real pain**

   - Pre-configured responses _are_ tedious at scale
   - This dramatically reduces setup friction

2. **Does not contaminate Green**

   - AI is not answering users
   - AI is helping the owner write content
   - Clear line, easy to explain

3. **Strong upsell lever**

   - Free users _see_ the value
   - Green users _accept_ the tradeoff
   - Pro users expect it

4. **Cost contained**

   - Setup-time usage only
   - Easy to budget and cap

---

## Copy matters (important)

Use language like:

- “AI-assisted setup”
- “Generate drafts”
- “You review before saving”

Avoid:

- “AI-powered bot” (in Green context)

---

## Bottom line

This is a **high-ROI feature** that:

- improves onboarding,
- strengthens Green,
- nudges upgrades naturally,
- and doesn’t break your product philosophy.

If you want, next I can:

- define exact per-plan generation limits,
- write the warning copy for Green,
- or produce the Cursor prompt/spec for the generator itself.
