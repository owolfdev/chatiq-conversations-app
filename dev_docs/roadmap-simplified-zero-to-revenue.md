💡 **Rule of thumb:**
Start asking for money the moment you can:

1. Create a bot,
2. Upload or link docs,
3. Get reliable answers, and
4. Charge through Stripe.

That’s your “Minimum Viable Value.”
Everything else—plugins, analytics, referrals—just accelerates growth after you’ve proven people will pay.
