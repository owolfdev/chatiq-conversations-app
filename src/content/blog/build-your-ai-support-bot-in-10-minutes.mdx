# How To Create Your AI Support Bot In Minutes

If you need a support bot fast, focus on scope, knowledge, and launch. This quick guide follows the actual ChatIQ flow so you can ship a helpful AI support bot in minutes, not weeks.

## 1) Define the scope (2-minute prep)

Before creating your bot, do a quick mental inventory. This prep work becomes the input we use to configure the bot.

Write down:

- The top 10 support questions you already get
- Where the bot will live first (website, docs, email)
- When the bot should hand off to a human

## 2) Create your bot from the dashboard

From your dashboard, click **Create New Bot** and use the form to describe the job. The description is the most important input because we use it to generate the name, system prompt, and starter responses.

Include:

- Who the bot is for and what it should solve (80–200 words)
- Optional tone (friendly, professional, technical)
- Optional website URL to ingest (about, docs, product page)
- Support contact info to route edge cases

Tap **Create Bot** to generate the bot. Your bot is created and ready to use! 🎉

## 3) Add knowledge

Upload documents or paste content so the bot has real answers. Use your best sources first:

- FAQs and help center articles
- Pricing, policies, and onboarding docs
- Past tickets or internal playbooks

Clean up the most important docs so they are clear, current, and easy to parse.

## 4) Test your bot

After creation, you land on the bot’s **Test** page. You can always return to it from **Bots** in the sidebar. Try your top support questions and confirm answers map to your documents.

If the bot misses, add or refine documents and try again.

## 5) Tune the bot

This is your control room for behavior and fast wins. Click **Tune** from the bot page to open it:

- Edit the **System Prompt** for tone, scope, and guardrails
- Set a **Default Response** for when AI is unavailable
- Add **Pre-configured Responses** for high-confidence replies
- Chat in private mode to test instantly

## 6) Review settings

Decide how the bot should behave in the real world. Click **Settings** from the bot page to adjust it:

- Set **Visibility** to Public if you want a public chat page
- Adjust **Status** (Active, Draft, Archived)
- Enable **Rich Responses (Markdown)** if your UI supports it
- Customize widget colors and styling

## 7) Embed it on your site

Generate a widget script, choose colors and position, and create an API key. Click **Embed** from the bot page, then restrict the key with **allowed domains** so it only runs where you expect.
