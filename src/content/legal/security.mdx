# Security Overview

**Version:** 1.0 &nbsp; | &nbsp; **Last updated:** November 11, 2025

Team Chat Code provides infrastructure and platform services that enable organizations to build multi-tenant AI chatbots. This document summarizes our security practices and design principles. **This is an overview, not a guarantee of security outcomes.**

## 1. Architecture Security

### 1.1 Multi-Tenancy Isolation

Our platform is designed with tenant isolation as a core principle:

- Every record carries a `team_id` and is protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Bots, documents, chunks, and embeddings are scoped to `team_id`; our query design aims to prevent cross-team access
- API calls resolve user → profile → team context on the server—never on the client
- We implement access controls and validation to enforce tenant boundaries

**Note:** While we implement multiple layers of isolation, no system is 100% secure. Customers should not rely solely on platform controls for sensitive data protection.

### 1.2 Encryption & Secrets

- **In transit:** We aim to enforce TLS 1.2+ for all HTTP and database connections
- **At rest:** Data stored in Supabase Postgres and Storage benefits from infrastructure-level encryption (AES-256 where supported by Supabase)
- **Secrets management:** API keys and sensitive configuration stored in Vercel/Supabase environment variables, with rotation procedures in place

**Note:** Encryption at rest depends on infrastructure provider capabilities. Customers should verify current encryption status for their data residency requirements.

## 2. Data Handling

### 2.1 Document Ingestion

- **Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, Markdown, TXT, HTML (whitelisted and sanitized)
- **Content moderation:** Uploaded text may be screened using OpenAI Moderation API; flagged files may be quarantined and excluded from embeddings
- **PII filtering:** Optional regex filtering for PII (emails, card numbers, SSNs) may be available

**Customer responsibility:** Customers are responsible for ensuring uploaded content complies with applicable laws and does not contain sensitive data requiring special handling.

### 2.2 Storage & Embeddings

- Files stored in Supabase Storage under `/teams/{team_id}/docs/{uuid}` paths
- Embeddings stored in Postgres pgvector, partitioned by `team_id` and `collection_id`
- Vectors contain semantic representations; we aim to avoid storing raw secrets or PII in vectors

### 2.3 Retention

- Customer content retained while the subscription is active
- Deleted documents and embeddings are targeted for hard-deletion within 30 days; actual deletion timing may vary
- Audit logs retained for approximately 90 days for security analysis

## 3. Application Security

### 3.1 Authentication & Access Control

- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email links, OAuth). JWTs validated on requests
- **Access controls:** Admin actions may require server-side validation and re-authentication
- **Bot visibility:** Bots respect visibility flags: _private_ (team-only) or _public_ (read-only sharing)

### 3.2 Rate Limiting & APIs

- Rate limiting implemented per team and per IP address to mitigate abuse
- API keys hashed with bcrypt, scoped to `team_id`, stored with encryption where supported
- Exponential back-off and suspension procedures for detected abuse

### 3.3 Audit & Monitoring

- Create/update/delete actions logged to `audit_log` tables
- Error and access logs streamed to logging services (Vercel Logs, Supabase Logs)
- Monitoring for suspicious patterns (e.g., excessive uploads) with alerting where configured

## 4. AI & Prompt Security

- **Moderation:** Prompts and uploads may be screened with OpenAI Moderation API before reaching model APIs
- **Context handling:** Retrieved context is intended to be ephemeral for individual requests; we aim not to use prompts or chunks for model training by default
- **Model providers:** We use vetted providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) accessed over TLS endpoints

**Note:** Model provider behavior, availability, and data usage policies are outside our control. Customers should review provider terms and configure settings accordingly.

## 5. Infrastructure

- **Hosting:** Services hosted on Vercel and Supabase (both report SOC 2 Type II certification)
- **Dependencies:** We aim to perform regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Application security:** We implement security headers (CSP, XSS, CSRF protections) where applicable
- **Backups:** Backup procedures in place; encryption status depends on infrastructure provider

**Note:** Infrastructure security depends on third-party providers. We rely on their certifications and security practices but do not control their operations.

## 6. Compliance & Roadmap

- **Data protection:** We aim to align our data handling practices with GDPR/PDPA principles
- **Terms compliance:** Our Terms of Service prohibit illegal, copyrighted, or sensitive data uploads
- **DPA availability:** Data Processing Addendum (DPA) available for enterprise customers upon request
- **SOC 2:** SOC 2 readiness assessment planned for Q3 2025 (roadmap item, not current status)
- **Future enhancements:** BYOK encryption and real-time anomaly detection are under consideration

## 7. Incident Response

- **Monitoring:** Incident channels monitored by our engineering team
- **Response process:** We aim to follow a standard process: detection → triage → containment → customer notification (target: within 72 hours where feasible)
- **Documentation:** Post-mortems documented; mitigation tasks tracked to closure

**Note:** Response times and procedures may vary based on incident severity and resource availability.

## 8. Vulnerability Reporting

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Report issues to [security@teamchatcode.com](mailto:security@teamchatcode.com). Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Your contact information

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide updates on remediation progress.

## 9. Customer Responsibilities

Customers are responsible for:

- Configuring bots, prompts, and settings appropriately for their use case
- Implementing appropriate disclosures and disclaimers for end users
- Ensuring Customer Content complies with applicable laws and regulations
- Managing access controls and user permissions within their teams
- Monitoring and responding to security incidents affecting their accounts

## 10. Limitations & Disclaimers

- **No absolute security:** No system is 100% secure. We implement security measures but cannot guarantee prevention of all security incidents
- **Third-party dependencies:** Our security posture depends on infrastructure providers (Vercel, Supabase) and AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic). Their security practices and availability are outside our direct control
- **Customer configuration:** Security outcomes depend in part on Customer's configuration choices, content, and use of the Services
- **Evolving threats:** Security practices evolve in response to new threats. This document reflects our current practices and may be updated
