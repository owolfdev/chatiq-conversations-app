# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** March 1, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ChatIQ platform and services ("Services") provided by Team Chat Code ("we," "us," or "our"). By creating an account or using the Services, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Accounts and Eligibility

- You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services.
- You are responsible for all activity on your account and for keeping your credentials secure.

## 2. Evaluation Plan (Non-Production Use)

If you are on the Evaluation plan, the Services are provided solely for evaluation purposes. You agree not to use the Evaluation plan in production or for live customer-facing deployments. The Evaluation plan includes strict usage caps and time limits, and it may be disabled when those limits are reached or the evaluation period ends.

## 3. Paid Plans and Billing

Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis. Taxes may apply. You may cancel at any time, and your access will continue until the end of the current billing period.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Services for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activities.
- Upload or process content you do not have the rights to use.
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services.

## 5. Customer Content

You retain ownership of your content. You grant us a limited license to host, process, and display your content solely to provide the Services.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Services may rely on third-party providers (e.g., AI model providers, hosting, and payment processors). Their services are subject to their own terms and policies.

## 7. Availability and Changes

We may modify or discontinue parts of the Services at any time. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.

## 8. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Services if you breach these Terms. You may terminate your account at any time.

## 9. Disclaimers

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
