# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to ChatIQ! This guide will walk you through creating your first AI chatbot in just a few minutes.

Skip this guide and click **Create New Bot** in your dashboard to get started.

## What is ChatIQ?

ChatIQ is a platform that lets you create custom AI chatbots powered by your own knowledge base. Your chatbot can:

- Answer questions based on your documents
- Maintain conversation context
- Be embedded on your website
- Be accessed via API

---

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [chatiq.io](https://chatiq.io) and click **Sign Up**
2. Create an account with your email or use a social login
3. Verify your email address (check your inbox)
4. You'll be redirected to your dashboard

**Tip:** Start with the Evaluation plan to explore all features!

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Bot

1. In your dashboard, click **Bots** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create New Bot**
3. Fill in the bot details:
   - **Description**: Who the bot is for and what it should solve (80–200 words is ideal)
   - **Tone**: Optional personality or voice
   - **Website**: Optional URL to ingest (about, product, or docs page)
   - **Support Contact**: Optional email, URL, or phone to share with users
4. Click **Create Bot**

ChatIQ will generate the bot name, system prompt, and starter responses automatically. You can refine everything in **Tune** and **Settings** after creation.

**Example Description:**

```
We need a support bot for our B2B analytics platform. It should help new users understand onboarding, explain pricing tiers, and route security questions to support@company.com. Keep answers concise and professional.
```

<div className="my-6">
  <Button
    asChild
    size="lg"
    className="bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 no-underline"
  >
    <a href="/dashboard/bots/new">+ Create New Bot</a>
  </Button>
</div>

## Step 3: Add Knowledge to Your Bot

Your bot needs knowledge to answer questions. Add documents that contain the information your bot should know.

### Option A: Add a Document

1. Click **Documents** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Document**
3. Fill in:
   - **Title**: Name your document (e.g., "Product FAQ")
   - **Content**: Paste or type the information your bot should know
   - **Tags**: Optional tags for organization (e.g., "faq", "product")
4. **Link to Bot**: Select your bot from the dropdown
5. Click **Save Changes**

The document will automatically be processed for AI search (this takes a few seconds).

### Option B: Upload Multiple Documents

You can add multiple documents and link them to the same bot. Each document becomes part of your bot's knowledge base.

**Tips for Better Results:**

- Write in clear, conversational language
- Use question-answer format when possible
- Include specific details (prices, dates, names)
- Break long documents into smaller, focused documents

---

## Step 4: Test Your Bot

After creation, you'll land on your bot's **Test** page. You can always return to it from **Bots** in the sidebar.

Try asking questions based on your documents:
- "What are your business hours?"
- "How do I reset my password?"
- "What products do you offer?"

Your bot should answer based on the documents you added!

**Troubleshooting:**

- If the bot doesn't answer correctly, check that your documents are fully processed (look for the embedding status)
- Make sure your documents contain relevant information
- Try rephrasing your questions

---

## Step 5: Tune Your Bot

Open **Tune** to refine the bot's behavior and add response patterns. Use the **Tune** button on your bot page.

Here you can:

- Update the **System Prompt** (role, scope, tone, and guardrails)
- Set a **Default Response** for when AI is unavailable
- Add **Pre-configured Responses** for high-confidence replies (greetings, contact, pricing)
- Chat with the bot in private mode to test changes instantly

**Example System Prompt:**

```
You are a helpful customer support assistant. Be friendly, concise, and always answer based on the provided documentation. If you are unsure, ask clarifying questions or route to support.
```

## Step 6: Review Settings

Open **Settings** to control visibility, status, and appearance. Use the **Settings** button on your bot page.

In Settings you can:

- Update the bot **Name**, **Description**, and **Slug**
- Set **Visibility** (Public/Private) and **Status** (Active/Draft/Archived)
- Enable **Rich Responses (Markdown)**
- Toggle **AI Responses** on or off
- Customize the widget **colors and styling**

---

## Step 7: Embed on Your Website

### Option A: Public Chat Page

Each bot has a public chat page you can link to:

```
https://bot.chatiq.io/your-bot-slug
```

Share this URL or link to it from your website. Set **Visibility → Public** in Settings to enable it.

### Option B: Embed Widget (Fastest)

Generate your embed code by clicking **Embed** on your bot page.

You'll create or select an API key, choose colors/position, and get a script tag like:

```html
<script
  src="https://www.chatiq.io/widget.js"
  data-bot-slug="your-bot-slug"
  data-api-key="your-api-key"
  data-source-label="web"
  data-position="bottom-right"
  data-primary-color="#10b981"
  async
></script>
```

**Security note:** Use the **allowed domains** field on the embed page to restrict where the key can run.

### Option C: Use the API

For full control, use the ChatIQ API to integrate the chatbot into your application. See the [API Getting Started Guide](/docs/api-getting-started) for details.

---

## Step 8: Monitor and Improve

### Rich responses (Markdown)

- **Default:** Bots reply in plain text.
- **Opt-in:** In **Dashboard → Bots → Settings → Rich responses (Markdown)**, toggle on to let the bot use Markdown (bullets, code fences, emphasis) for clearer answers.
- **Widget compatibility:** If you enable this, ensure your chat UI renders Markdown.
- **API clients:** If you use the API directly, either render Markdown on your side or leave the toggle off to keep plain text.

### View Analytics

1. Click **Analytics** in the sidebar
2. See:
   - Total conversations
   - Messages sent
   - Popular questions
   - User engagement

### Improve Your Bot

- **Add more documents** as you discover gaps in knowledge
- **Review conversations** to see what users are asking
- **Update system prompts** to refine bot behavior
- **Test regularly** to ensure quality responses
