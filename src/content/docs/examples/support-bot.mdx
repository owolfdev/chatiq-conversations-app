can help! Email us at support@example.com or visit our help center."
```

### Add Personality

Make the bot match your brand voice:

```
You are a friendly and professional customer support assistant. 
Use a warm, helpful tone. Always acknowledge the customer's concern 
before providing an answer.
```

## Step 5: Embed on Your Website

### Option 1: Public Chat Page

Link to your bot's public page:

```html
<a href="https://bot.chatiq.io/support-bot">
  Chat with Support
</a>
```

### Option 2: API Integration

Use the API to create a custom chat widget:

```javascript
// Your website's chat widget
async function askSupport(question) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/support-chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: question }),
  });
  return response.json();
}
```
