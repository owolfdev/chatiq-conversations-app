## Advanced: Dynamic Recommendations

Enhance your system prompt for better recommendations:

```
You are a product assistant. When customers ask about products:

1. First, understand their needs (team size, use case, budget)
2. Recommend the best-fit product
3. Explain why it's a good fit
4. Mention alternatives if relevant
5. Always provide accurate pricing
```

---

## Integration Example

```javascript
// Product recommendation widget
async function getProductRecommendation(needs) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/product-assistant', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `I need a product for: ${needs}`,
    }),
  });
  return response.json();
}
```
