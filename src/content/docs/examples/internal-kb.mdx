find information about policies, procedures, tools, and benefits.

Be friendly and approachable. If you don't know something, direct them to 
the right person or resource.
```

## Step 4: Test Your Bot

Test with common questions:

- "How do I request time off?"
- "What are our company holidays?"
- "How do I set up my development environment?"
- "What benefits are available?"
- "What's the remote work policy?"

---

## Step 5: Share with Your Team

### Option 1: Direct Link

Share the bot's public chat page URL (if public) or dashboard link (if private).

### Option 2: Embed in Internal Tools

Embed the bot in your:
- Company intranet
- Internal wiki (Notion, Confluence)
- Slack workspace (via webhook)
- Internal dashboard

### Option 3: API Integration

Use the API to integrate into existing tools:

```javascript
// Example: Add to internal dashboard
const response = await fetch('https://chatiq.io/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: userQuestion,
    bot_slug: 'internal-kb',
  }),
});
```
