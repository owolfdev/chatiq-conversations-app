## Plan Limits & Usage

### What Happens When You Reach Limits?

If you approach or exceed your plan limits, you'll receive notifications:

- **Warning at 80%** — You'll be notified when you reach 80% of your limits
- **At 100%** — You'll need to either:
  - Upgrade your plan
  - Remove some items (documents, bots) to stay within limits
  - Wait until your usage resets (for monthly message limits)

**Important:** We won't delete your data if you exceed limits. You'll simply need to manage your usage or upgrade.

### Message Limits

- **Evaluation:** 100 AI calls during your 14-day evaluation period
- **Pro:** 2,000 AI calls per month (shared across all bots)
- **Business:** 10,000 AI calls per month (shared across all bots and the team)
- **Enterprise:** Custom limits based on your agreement

**Note:** Pre-configured responses and cached responses don't count toward message limits.

### Document Limits

- Documents are counted per account and can be linked to one or more bots
- Embeddings are generated automatically when you process documents
- Large documents may create multiple embeddings
- We do not enforce a separate embeddings cap; document limits and the 20k character cap serve as the practical ceiling

- You can delete and recreate bots as needed
- Deleted bots don't count toward your limit
