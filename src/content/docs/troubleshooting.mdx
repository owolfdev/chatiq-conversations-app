# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and quick fixes for ChatIQ integrations.

---

## Widget Not Showing

- Confirm your script tag is added right before `</body>`.
- Make sure `data-bot-slug` matches an **active** bot.
- Disable ad blockers or test in an incognito window.
- Check the browser console for blocked network requests.

---

## Bot Not Responding

- Verify your bot status is **Active** in the dashboard.
- Make sure documents finished processing (embeddings).
- Try a simple test question to confirm baseline behavior.

---

## API Errors (401/403)

- Confirm your API key is valid and active.
- Ensure the key is used server-side only.
- Check that your key has access to the bot slug you are using.

---

## API Errors (429)

- You may be rate-limited.
- Add a retry with backoff or contact support for limits.

---

## Streaming Issues

- Ensure your proxy forwards `text/event-stream` correctly.
- Disable response buffering on your server.
- Confirm the client is reading the stream incrementally.
