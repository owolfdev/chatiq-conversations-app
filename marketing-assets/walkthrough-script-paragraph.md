Hi! Welcome to ChatIQ.

I'm going to show you how easy it is to create an AI chatbot, upload your knowledge base, and start chatting—all in under 5 minutes.

Let's start by creating a new bot.

First, I'll create a new chatbot.

I'll give it a name, a description, and a unique URL slug.

I'm creating a 'ChatIQ Support Bot' that will help answer questions about our platform.

I'll set it as public so anyone can chat with it, and I'll add a system prompt that defines its personality and behavior.

The system prompt tells the bot how to behave. I'll set it to be helpful and reference the documentation we'll upload.

And that's it! The bot is created.

Now let's add some knowledge to it. Now I'll upload a document that contains the information the bot needs to answer questions. This could be a FAQ, product documentation, or any text content.

I'll give it a title—let's call it 'ChatIQ Support FAQ'—paste the content from our FAQ document, add relevant tags like 'support, faq, help, documentation, getting-started, billing' to help the bot match this document to user questions, and most importantly—link it to the bot we just created.

By linking this document to the bot, the AI will be able to search through it when answering questions.

The document is created and automatically processed. The system breaks it into chunks and creates embeddings—essentially making it searchable by the AI. This usually takes just a few seconds in the background.

Perfect! The document is now ready.

Let's test the bot.

Now let's chat with our bot. I'll ask it a question that should be answered by the document we just uploaded. I'm asking: 'How do I create my first bot?' The bot is searching through the document we uploaded and generating an answer based on that content.

Perfect! The bot answered using information from our document. Notice how it's not just generic responses—it's actually using the specific content we provided.

Let me ask a follow-up question to show how the conversation flows naturally.

The bot maintains context from our conversation and continues to reference the uploaded documentation.

That's it! In just a few minutes, we've created a custom AI chatbot, uploaded knowledge base content, and started having intelligent conversations. You can create multiple bots, upload unlimited documents, and customize everything to fit your needs. The bot is live and ready to use—you can share the chat link with your team or embed it on your website.

Thanks for watching! If you have questions, feel free to reach out.
